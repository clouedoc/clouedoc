# Camille LouÃ©doc-Eyries

Hello ðŸ‘‹

- I like computers, nootropics, electronic music and trees.
- My job is making computers act like humans, so that you can extract the data you need.
- ~~You can hire me for 150$/hour. I can type the right words into your computer.~~
  -  I don't really accept offers now. I settled down with ScrapingBee.
  -  But I will still advise you for free, and give recommendations, if you contact me ðŸ™‚
  -  And can do a bit of consulting. 

## Get to know me

### Philosophy

- You cannot improve what you cannot measure.
- Use the right tools for the job.
- Decouple flaky software
- Your database should mirror the reality
- Store everything; storage is cheap but data is not
- Evaluate each of your actions through the lens of your current goal
- Don't obsesss too much over optimization; CPU-time is cheap, brain-time is not.
- Reverse-engineer life
- [Have boring code](https://blog.beeminder.com/magic/)
