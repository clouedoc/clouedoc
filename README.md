# Camille Louédoc-Eyries

Hello 👋

I'm a software engineer with reverse-engineering chops.

I specialise in hard-to-crack data acquisition problems at scale (i.e, reliably bypassing anti-scraping systems at scale)

I am available for consulting at the price of 150$/hour.

### Philosophy

- You cannot improve what you cannot measure.
- Use the right tools for the job.
- Decouple flaky software
- Your database should mirror the reality
- Store everything; storage is cheap but data is not
- Evaluate each of your actions through the lens of your current goal
- Don't obsesss too much over optimization; CPU-time is cheap, brain-time is not.
- Reverse-engineer life
- [Have boring code](https://blog.beeminder.com/magic/)
- Pick boring technology
- Be humble; there is always something to learn by listening to others
- Take a walk when the next step is not clear.
- Great work is done in isolation.
- Pen&paper can do wonders

### Technology

Of course, picking the right tools for the job is the most important part.

But here is a list of technologies that I use and love along with a small comment.

- Telemetry: Grafana, VictoriaMetrics, ClickHouse, (Loki — unfortunately)
- Orchestration:
  - Kubernetes (on Hetzner to save $$$)
  - Good old makefiles with `scp`
- Programming languages I am proefficient in
  - TypeScript
  - Python
  - Go
  - SQL
- Programming languages I'm learning
  - Rust (❤️)
- Databases:
  - PostgreSQL
  - ClickHouse
  - Redis/Dragonfly
- Queues:
  - AMQP (RabbitMQ)
  - BullMQ

#### Technologies wishlist

These are technologies I wish to adopt but couldn't get the chance to play around with them enough yet.

- [Trigger](https://trigger.dev) --> I'm not sure if I want to put more of my bytes into another VC-backed project...
- [XState](https://xstate.js.org/) --> I can't bear that syntax. I ended up learning Rust instead.

### Productivity

#### Tools

- [Beeminder](beeminder.com) - to force me to do the boring tasks
- [Kindle Scribe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Kindle) - to jot down my thoughts
