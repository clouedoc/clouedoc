# Camille LouÃ©doc-Eyries

Hello ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer with reverse-engineering chops.
I am available for consulting for 150$/hour.

## Get to know me

### Philosophy

- You cannot improve what you cannot measure.
- Use the right tools for the job.
- Decouple flaky software
- Your database should mirror the reality
- Store everything; storage is cheap but data is not
- Evaluate each of your actions through the lens of your current goal
- Don't obsesss too much over optimization; CPU-time is cheap, brain-time is not.
- Reverse-engineer life
- [Have boring code](https://blog.beeminder.com/magic/)
- Pick boring technology
- Be humble; there is always something to learn by listening to others
- Take a walk when the next step is not clear.
- Great work is done in isolation.
- Pen&paper can do wonders

### Technology

Of course, picking the right tools for the job is the most important part.

But here is a list of technologies that I use and love along with a small comment.

- Telemetry: Grafana, VictoriaMetrics, (Loki â€” I don't love it but it does the job)
- Orchestration: Kubernetes (on Hetzner Cloud to save $$$)
- Programming languages
  - TypeScript (Absolutely love it. Yes, the tooling is questionnable, but the type system gives me goosebumps)
  - Python (I hated it, then I was put to work into a Python codebase, and now I am a bit more measured.)
  - Go (I use it when I need performance or want to mimic TLS/h2 perfectly)
  - Kotlin (always useful when automating Android apps ðŸ˜ƒ)
  - Bash
  - SQL
- Databases: I love PostgreSQL and had a bad experience with MongoDB early on. I am fascinated by distributed databases like Cassandra. I recently started using ClickHouse. (a few weeks later: I love ClickHouse!) (on the other hand, my experience with MongoDB was not the best...)
- Queues: I like RabbitMQ, but the boilerplate is a bit too much for me...

#### Technologies wishlist

These are technologies I wish to adopt but couldn't get the chance to play around with them enough yet.

- [Trigger](https://trigger.dev)
- [XState](https://xstate.js.org/)

### Productivity

#### Tools

- [Beeminder](beeminder.com) - to force me to do the boring tasks
- Todoist â€” to remember me to do the boring tasks
- A good old notebook! â€” to help me reason about the interesting tasks
